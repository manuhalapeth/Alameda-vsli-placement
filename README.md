# Alameda-vsli-placement
A machine learning system that learns to optimize chip layouts using differentiable loss functions. The model iteratively takes actions to reposition components, learning to eliminate overlaps and reduce wirelength through gradient-based feedback, helping automate a critical step in hardware design.
